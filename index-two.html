                            style="float: right; width: 20vw; margin: 1rem">How it works - Create your referral offer
You create your own sponsorship offer. This is usually made up of a condition (the outcome you desire) and a monetary value. This is the amount you are willing to pay to the fan's favorite sports club when they redeem your offer. Your offer should be attractive, easy to understand, easy to communicate and easy to execute.

For example: if you are a pizza place, your referral offer would look like "buy a pizza and earn $1 for your favorite sports club".

In addition to encouraging buying behaviors, your referral offer can also encourage attention behaviors. Sponsors can upload all types of digital marketing materials, including videos, to the Reunited platform and reward fans for watching, such as "watch my latest TV spot and earn $0.50 for your sports club favorite".

Every time fans spend money with your business, you provide them with the means to redeem your referral offer and send money to their favorite sports clubs, teams, or athletes. The Reunited dashboard along with our developer tools and APIs offer many options for sponsorship integrations, including:

Alphanumeric and QR codes on paper

                   How it works - Promoting your referral offer
With Reunited, we give you many ways to promote your referral offer to new and existing customers across different channels. Use our templates to create stunning social media posters and images that can be used to promote your offer directly in your store or on your social media channels.

With Reunited you can support one or dozens or hundreds or thousands of sports clubs, teams and athletes at the same time. Risk-free and fully transactional. You can add an emotional engine to your existing product offering to attract more customers and offer something great that your competitors aren't doing, which is supporting local and regional sports clubs.
                     How it works - Connect with fans and clubs
As soon as a fan redeems a code for their favorite sports club, we will establish a digital CRM relationship between the fan and your business and between the selected club and your business. This allows you to reach more fans and grow your business. The Reunited dashboard allows you to watch all buyouts in real time and see all relationships with fans, sports clubs, teams and athletes.

The Reunited Dashboard also offers many other ways to attract more customers and engage with them. For example: an integrated loyalty system, exclusive coupons, follow-up actions, customer relationship management (CRM), welcome gifts, instant prize draws and many more.

                                            qualification of the token issued. To do this, he will have to analyze what

                                            of
                                            underlying financial asset the token is backed by. He can go through an STO

                                            he

                                            blockchain through a specialized company. In these two cases, the token will
                                            be
                                            qualified as a security token.

                                            Similarly, the fundraising operation is qualified as an STO when the tokens

                                            be

                                            In France, STOs are regulated and subject to IPO "prospectus" legislation as

                                            STOs
                                            must

                                            Good to know: on March 6, 2020, the AMF published a note relating to the
                                            regulation
                                            of STOs which mentioned the prohibition, for SAS, to make use of a public
                                            offering
                                            of financial securities. This prohibition comes under the provisions of
                                            article
                                            L.227-2 of the French Commercial Code.

                                            According to the AMF, SAS wishing to raise funds could use a crowdfunding
                                            offer
                                            under the following conditions:

                                            That the offer is less than 8 million euros;
                                            That the offer targets more than 149 people;
                                            That the amount per security is less than €100,000;
                                            Go through a crowdfunding site.</p>

                                            physical asset, registered on a blockchain. The token will then be issued on
                                            it
                                            and

                                            Tokenization
                                            Tokenization is the process of representing the ownership of a security or
                                            real
                                            estate and the rights attached to it on a digital token registered on a
                                            blockchain.
                                            In other words, tokenization allows the securitization of both a physical
                                            and a
                                            digital asset in the form of a token.



                                            The tokenization of a financial asset
                                            Tokenization of a financial asset is the process of registering a financial
                                            instrument or a fraction of the ownership of it and the rights attached to
                                            it on
                                            a

                                            Ultimately, for the issuer, it will be a question of backing a financial
                                            asset

                                            provide a high level of security and trust by verifying and validating

                                            within the framework of a validation consensus (generally, in "Proof of

                                            proof of work). This IT consensus makes it possible to develop a database
